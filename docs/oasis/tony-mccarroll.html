        <p>Tony McCarroll (born 4 June 1971) is best known as the original drummer of the iconic rock band Oasis. He played a crucial role in Oasis's early years, contributing to the band's distinctive sound and energetic performances. McCarroll's drumming style provided the backbone for many of Oasis's early hits, including tracks from their debut album "Definitely Maybe" (1994) such as "Rock 'n' Roll Star" and "Live Forever," helping to establish the band as leaders of the Britpop movement in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Despite his significant contributions to Oasis's early success, McCarroll's tenure with the band was short-lived due to creative differences with the Gallagher brothers. He departed from Oasis in 1995, shortly after the release of their sophomore album "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?" His departure marked a significant change in the band's lineup, but McCarroll's legacy as Oasis's original drummer remains integral to their early history and enduring impact on the music scene.</p>

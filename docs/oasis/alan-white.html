          <p>
            Alan White (born 26 May 1972) is a drummer best known for his tenure
            with the iconic rock band Oasis. White joined Oasis in 1995,
            replacing original drummer Tony McCarroll during a period of
            transition for the band. His powerful and dynamic drumming style
            helped Oasis maintain their momentum and contributed to the success
            of albums such as "Be Here Now" (1997) and "Standing on the Shoulder
            of Giants" (2000), which featured hits like "D'You Know What I
            Mean?" and "Go Let It Out."
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout his time with Oasis, White's drumming provided a solid
            foundation for the band's music, blending seamlessly with Noel
            Gallagher's songwriting and Liam Gallagher's vocals. His
            contributions to Oasis's later albums showcased his versatility and
            adaptability as a drummer, cementing his place as an integral member
            of the band during a crucial period in their career.

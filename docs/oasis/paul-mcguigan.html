          <p>
            Paul McGuigan (born 9 May 1971), commonly known as "Guigsy," is a
            British musician best known for his role as the bassist of the
            iconic rock band Oasis. McGuigan played a critical part in shaping
            Oasis's distinctive sound during their formative years and their
            meteoric rise to fame in the 1990s. Alongside his bandmates,
            including brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher, McGuigan contributed to
            the band's success with his melodic bass lines and steady rhythm,
            helping to solidify Oasis's reputation as one of the most
            significant acts of the Britpop era.
          </p>
          <p>
            McGuigan's tenure with Oasis spanned from the band's inception in
            1991 until his departure in 1999, following the recording sessions
            for their fourth studio album, "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants."
            Throughout his time with Oasis, McGuigan's bass playing provided a
            solid foundation for the band's anthemic hits, including
            "Wonderwall," "Don't Look Back in Anger," and "Champagne Supernova."
            His contributions to the band's early albums, such as "Definitely
            Maybe" (1994) and "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?" (1995), helped
            shape the sound that propelled Oasis to international fame.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following his departure from Oasis, McGuigan largely retreated from
            the spotlight, choosing to focus on his personal life away from the
            music industry. While he has kept a low profile in recent years,
            McGuigan remains an important figure in Oasis's history, remembered
            for his role in shaping the band's sound and contributing to their
            success during their heyday in the 1990s.

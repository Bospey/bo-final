            Gem Archer (born 7 December 1966) is a guitarist and songwriter
            recognized for his contributions to the British rock band Oasis.
            Joining Oasis in 1999, Archer brought a new dimension to the band's
            sound with his proficient guitar playing and songwriting skills. His
            arrival marked a period of rejuvenation for Oasis, and he played a
            significant role in shaping the band's later albums, including
            "Heathen Chemistry" (2002) and "Don't Believe the Truth" (2005),
            which featured hits such as "The Hindu Times" and "Lyla."

            Beyond his role as a guitarist, Archer's songwriting contributions
            added depth and variety to Oasis's repertoire, showcasing his talent
            for crafting memorable melodies and insightful lyrics. His
            collaboration with Noel Gallagher and other bandmates helped sustain
            Oasis's relevance in the changing landscape of British rock music,
            solidifying his place as a respected member of the band until their
            eventual breakup in 2009.

<p>In addition to his instrumental prowess, Bell's songwriting talents enriched Oasis's later albums, with notable contributions to tracks such as "Born on a Different Cloud" and "Turn Up the Sun." His collaboration with Noel Gallagher and the rest of the band helped maintain Oasis's relevance and musical quality amidst changing trends in the rock scene.

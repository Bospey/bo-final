          <p>
            Paul Arthurs (born 23 June 1965), better known by his stage name
            "Bonehead," is a British musician and guitarist recognized for his
            tenure with the iconic rock band Oasis. Arthurs played a crucial
            role in shaping Oasis's distinctive sound during their meteoric rise
            to fame in the 1990s. Alongside his bandmates, including brothers
            Liam and Noel Gallagher, Arthurs contributed to the band's success
            with his solid rhythm guitar playing and collaborative songwriting
            efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthurs's involvement with Oasis spanned from the band's formation
            in 1991 until his departure in 1999, following the recording
            sessions for their fourth studio album, "Standing on the Shoulder of
            Giants." His contributions to Oasis's early albums, including
            "Definitely Maybe" (1994) and "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?"
            (1995), helped establish the band as one of the most significant
            acts of the Britpop era. Arthurs's distinctive guitar work can be
            heard on classic Oasis tracks such as "Live Forever," "Supersonic,"
            and "Some Might Say," which remain beloved by fans worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following his departure from Oasis, Arthurs pursued other musical
            ventures, including collaborations with various artists and
            occasional live performances. While he hasn't achieved the same
            level of mainstream success as during his Oasis years, Arthurs
            remains an important figure in the band's history and continues to
            be respected within the music community for his contributions to
            British rock music.
